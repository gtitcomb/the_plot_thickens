## This site is in progress! 

This site is meant to be a resource for anyone hoping to extend their plotting skills in R. Almost all of the plots are made using ggplot2 and a variety of accessory packages. The topics cover a wide range of plotting applications; most of these arose from real situations when we were faced with a unique plotting problem in the course of doing ecological research and finding creative and reproducible ways to report the results. 

Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned as we add more content!
